Apologies Boss, I edited my submission to my stage 2 movie discovery web application project.

previously:
Hosted link: https://movie-discovery-web-app-traez.vercel.app/
The GitHub URL: https://github.com/traez/movie-discovery-web-app

Now:
Hosted link: https://movie-discovery-webapp-traez.vercel.app/
The GitHub URL: https://github.com/traez/movie-discovery-webapp

Only change is "web-app" changed to "webapp" 
Hope no issues please as grading is supposedly yet to start?
